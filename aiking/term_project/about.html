                    <p>I started making my own cards when I needed one for a certain occasion and just could not find the right one.
						Then other people who received my cards would ask me to make one for them, for one thing or another.  
						From there it lead to the desire to make cards that anyone to could enjoy. This slide show gives and example of how my cards turn out.  
						Each card made is unique. This is part of what makes them so special.  Thus becoming a keepsake.

                  <p style="text-align: left;">Welcome to my website,</p></br>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kingsakes was in reality started in the 1980's, but never came out of hiding until thirty years later. 
I am a Michigander born and raised.  Although I tried the sunny south for about five years, the north woods always called me back home. That's where my heart lies and my happiness blooms.
I am the wife of one of the worlds kindest most thoughtful men. We are parents of two wonderful young men, who have given their father and I many years of wonderful memories to hold dear in our hearts and strong in our minds even when the years get short.
Alexander is our oldest, and he is our "thinker", he is the manager of my website and my go to when I need a reality check.  Christopher came along six years later and he is our "doer", if there is something we need done or fixed he is the man we call.  Both of our sons are quite remarkable in my opinion, and anyone who truly knows them is blessed.
Both boys are very good at drawing, writing and various crafts, that I have tried to nurture through out the years.
My enjoyment of crafting bleeds into all aspects of my life.  I even inject as much as possible into my actual outside employment position. Which can sometimes be greeted with massive enthusiasm and yes, sometimes falls flat.
Growing up I had always planned to become a grade school art teacher.  But the best laid plans don't always become reality. 
It is that desire, which still burns strongly, to share my love and the magic of crafting with the world that makes this endeavor important to me.   
So in conclusion, I hope you enjoy your visit to Kingsakes the first time and every time, whether it is to buy for yourself or to give as a gift, may you find a keepsake each and every time. Thank you for stopping by.</p>
</br>
<p style="text-align: left;">Happy Crafting,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Luella King</p>
